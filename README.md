## 📌 Introduction

Fraudulent credit card transactions cost the financial industry billions of dollars every year. Traditional rule-based systems are no longer enough to keep up with increasingly sophisticated fraud techniques.

This project tackles the **real-world challenge** of fraud detection using **Machine Learning and Data Analytics**. Using a dataset of over 284,000 transactions — with only **0.17% labeled as fraud** — this project builds an end-to-end pipeline that:

- Handles severe class imbalance
- Extracts insights through detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Applies a **Random Forest Classifier** to detect fraudulent activity
- Evaluates results using precision, recall, F1-score, and MCC (not just accuracy)
- Visualizes patterns and risk areas using clear and interactive graphs

🔍 **Why this project matters**  
Detecting fraud is not just about prediction — it's about **reducing false negatives** to protect users, **improving trust** in digital systems, and **maximizing financial impact** through smart data science. This project mirrors the kind of work data analysts and data scientists do at companies like banks, fintech startups, or e-commerce platforms.

📚 **What You’ll Learn**

- Clean and explore real-world tabular datasets
- Use correlation and feature patterns to drive insight
- Handle class imbalance (minority class problems)
- Build and evaluate robust models using Scikit-learn
- Use data storytelling to present business-critical results
