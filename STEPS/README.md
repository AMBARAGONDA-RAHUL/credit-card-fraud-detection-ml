## Step 1: Importing Necessary Libraries

In this step, we start by importing the essential Python libraries that will be used throughout this project. These libraries help us manage data, create visualizations, and prepare the environment for building machine learning models.

### Libraries Overview:

- **`numpy`**: Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on them efficiently.
- **`pandas`**: Offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series, perfect for data cleaning and analysis.
- **`matplotlib`**: A plotting library to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **`seaborn`**: Built on top of matplotlib, it provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- **`gridspec` from matplotlib**: Helps in arranging multiple plots in a grid layout for better visualization.

### Code to Import Libraries:

```python
import numpy as np  
import pandas as pd  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
import seaborn as sns  
from matplotlib import gridspec
